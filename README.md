Exercise 1: I added my addFace fuction as the sprite that would be moving around. Above function setUp(), I have 4 variable; x,y, and their indivual speeds.
I defined those variable in the setup function. In function draw(), I set x and y up to be effected by the speed variables. That step moves my sprite around.
Under those, I created if statements to determine when it would 'bounce' against the border and move back.

Exercise 2: I made a copy of exercise one, and added a keyPressed function under the draw function. There I set up if-else statements that would allow me to 
move my sprite with tapping my arrow keys. To do that, I made speed(X/Y)= speed(X/Y) * -1, which changes the direction which the sprite is moving oppisite 
of its original direction.

(Sorry this is late, I didnt realize I hadn't turned it in until now)
